# Contributing to Jakarta Agentic Artificial Intelligence

Thanks for your interest n Jakarta Agentic AI.

## Project description

The project provides an API to facilitate the execution of AI agents on
Jakarta EE runtimes. It defines the API contract between the runtime and
agent implementation. This is similar to what Servlet did for HTTP
processing, Jakarta REST did for RESTful web services, or perhaps most
appropriately, Jakarta Batch did for batch processing. The annotation-based
API will define common usage patterns and life cycles that make it as
understandable, consistent, and easy as possible to implement different
types of agents. CDI is used as a core component model for the API. The
project will likely also define integrations with other key Jakarta EE APIs
such as Validation, REST, JSON Binding, Persistence, Data, Transactions,
NoSQL, Concurrency, Security, Messaging, and so on. The project aims for
the broadest industry consensus possible by engaging as many relevant
subject matter experts and API consumers as possible, from within the
Java/Jakarta EE ecosystem as well as externally.
